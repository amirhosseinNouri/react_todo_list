# React Todo List

I used React and Bootstrap for this project.

This is a practice for [React Tutorial and Projects Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/).

Checkout the final result [here](https://amirhosseinnouri-react-todo-list.netlify.app/) (you should probably use a VPN).

# TODO

- [ ] Change class-based component to functional-based component and use React Hook to store tasks in localStorage.
